# correlation 0.6.1

## Breaking Changes

- `robust` argument deprecated in favour of `ranktransform`.

## New Features

- `correlation` gains two new arguments: `select` and `select2` to select
  specific variables from dataframes to compare (#146).
  
- `as.matrix` method works for grouped correlations (#148).

## Bug Fixes

- The `0.6.0` release introduced a bug in Winsorized Pearson correlation where
  the missing values were removed from the entire data, instead for each pair
  (#151). This is now fixed.

# correlation 0.6.0

## New Features

- Added `verbose` arguments to some functions, to toggle warnings on/off.

- `cor_test()` (and hence, `correlation()`) now default the `winsorize` argument
  to `.1` when it's set to `TRUE`.

- The `Method` column in output dataframe is now more explicit about the
  correlation method used.

## Bug Fixes

- Winsorization doesn't fail when `NA`s are present (#130).

## Minor Changes

- Fixed CRAN check issues due to changes in dependent packages.

# correlation 0.5.0

## Changes

- Added `winsorize()` function.

- Added `winsorize` argument for Winsorized correlations.

- Added `method = "somers"` to `correlation()`, to compute Somers's Dxy rank
  correlation for binary outcomes.

- New function `display()`, to print output into different formats. Currently,
  only markdown is supported. `print_md()` is an alias for `display(format =
  "markdown")`.

## Bug fixes

- Fix bug in `cor_to_p()` that gave slightly different test statistics.

# correlation 0.4.0

## Changes

- Don't error if less than 3 valid observations
  ([#100](https://github.com/easystats/correlation/issues/100)).

- Add "gaussian" rank method.

- Add "gamma" method.

- Add "hoeffding" method.

- Add "blomqvist" method.

## Bug fixes

- Added `Method` column to Bayesian correlations.

- Fix bug when `robust=TRUE`
  ([#87](https://github.com/easystats/effectsize/issues/87)).

# correlation 0.3.0

## Changes

## Bug fixes

# correlation 0.2.1

## Changes

- Added confidence intervals CI support for Spearman and Kendall (#80)

- Improved documentation (#45, #63)

## Bug fixes

- Removed CI threshold column from `distance_mahalanobis()`

- Fixed bug (#76)

# correlation 0.2.0

## Changes

- Some changes were made.

## Bug fixes

- Some bugs were fixed.

# correlation 0.1.0

## Changes

- Initial CRAN release.

- Add `plot()`-method for `summary()`.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed issue in `correlation()` for some edge cases when `include_factors =
  TRUE`.

- Fixed issue in `correlation()` for correlation coefficients with less than
  four complete pairs of observations (in such cases, `cor_test()` now returns
  `NA` for the confidence intervals).
